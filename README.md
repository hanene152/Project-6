The goal of this lab assignment is to understand and implement server-side validation of HTML forms using node.js. In this assignment you will be given a template (here: p6-template.zip Download p6-template.zip), which includes an HTML form and JavaScript skeleton to validate the inputs before processing the form data. You will be converting this code to work on the server-side using node.js. Node allows the use of JavaScript to be used as a server side language for validating the post requests of the form being submitted. Modify the provided code to do the following server-side tasks:

Validate each field according to the specified rules. Display error messages if the validation fails. Create a

tag with your messages with class error. Use the following error messages stored to display: "Name is required.", "Email is required.", "Password is required." "Name must be alphabetic and between 2 and 50 characters." "Password must be at least 6 characters long." "Invalid email format." "Age must be a number between 1 and 120." Display a success message if the validation passes. Create a

tag with your message with class success. Validation Rules

Name: Required, must be alphabetic and between 2 and 50 characters. Email: Required, must be a valid email format. Password: Required, must be at least 6 characters long. Age: Optional, if provided, must be a number between 1 and 120. Here is an assignment guide to follow for setting up node: NodeJS Server Setup Guide.pdf

NOTE: INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS IN A README SHOWING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESULTS!
