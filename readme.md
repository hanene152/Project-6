The goal of this lab assignment is to understand and implement server-side validation of HTML forms using node.js. In this assignment you will be given a template (here: p6-template.zip Download p6-template.zip), which includes an HTML form and JavaScript skeleton to validate the inputs before processing the form data. You will be converting this code to work on the server-side using node.js. Node allows the use of JavaScript to be used as a server side language for validating the post requests of the form being submitted. Modify the provided code to do the following server-side tasks:

Validate each field according to the specified rules.
Display error messages if the validation fails.
Create a <p> tag with your messages with class error. 
Use the following error messages stored to display:
"Name is required.", "Email is required.", "Password is required."
"Name must be alphabetic and between 2 and 50 characters."
"Password must be at least 6 characters long."
"Invalid email format."
"Age must be a number between 1 and 120."
Display a success message if the validation passes.
Create a <p> tag with your message with class success.
Validation Rules

Name: Required, must be alphabetic and between 2 and 50 characters.
Email: Required, must be a valid email format.
Password: Required, must be at least 6 characters long.
Age: Optional, if provided, must be a number between 1 and 120.
Here is an assignment guide to follow for setting up node: NodeJS Server Setup Guide.pdf
